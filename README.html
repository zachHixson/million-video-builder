        <h1>Million Video Builder</h1>
        <p>This program is used to generate a video sequence of the digits of PI based on a series of input video and input text list</p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Windows 10 OS</li>
            <li>32GB Ram (will work with less RAM, but will be much slower)</li>
            <li>Make sure you have <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> installed and accessible from command line</li>
            <li>Folder containing <span class="code">.MP4</span> video clips for digits 0-9 with the naming convention <span class="code">#.mp4</span>, as well as a single clip titled <span class="code">gap.mp4</span></li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to run</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place <span class="code">million-video-builder.exe</span> into the root project directory</li>
            <li>With the command line pointed to the project directory, run <span class="code">.\million-video-builder.exe [src_folder\path] [path\to\output_folder]</span> (without [ ] braces)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Optionally you can add a <span class="code">-debug</span> flag at the end of the above command to display FFmpeg debug output</p>

        <h2>Pausing, Resuming, and Restarting</h2>
        If you want to pause the render, you can do so easily by exiting the command prompt window. The render will resume where it left off next time the program is run (as long as the output directory is the same)
        <br /><br />
        If you would like to restart the process from scratch, simply delete the existing output directory or provide a new output directory to render to.
